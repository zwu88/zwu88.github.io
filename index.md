## About Me

I'm a forth-year undergraduate student at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). From August 2024 to October 2025, I worked as a research assistant at Yale University under the supervision of Prof. [Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu/) and Prof. [David van Dijk](https://www.vandijklab.org/), completing two projects on operator learning. Since September 2025, I have been working with Prof. [Paris Perdikaris](https://ai4science.seas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, leading a self-initiated research project.

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, scientific computing, and computational physics. I am particularly interested in developing scalable and robust algorithms for solving partial differential equations, and leveraging these algorithms to solve challenging problems in science and engineering.
